* About
- This is a collection of [[https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html][Lmod files]] for HPC clusters
- More details about this are on [[https://rgoswami.me/posts/nix-hpc-tramp][my website here]]
- These are managed by [[https://github.com/kobus-v-schoor/dotgit][dotgit]]

** Background
These split off from [[https://github.com/HaoZeke/Dotfiles][my Dotfiles]] for the same reason my [[https://dotdoom.rgoswami.me][famous Emacs configuration split]], that is they take up an exorbitant amount of commits.

* Usage
See the post for more details, but in general:
- [ ] Get ~dotgit~
- [ ] Use ~dotgit~
To spell it out:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://github.com/kobus-v-schoor/dotgit.git
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
cp -r dotgit/bin/dotgit* ~/.local/bin
cat dotgit/bin/bash_completion >> ~/.bash_completion
rm -rf dotgit
#+END_SRC
I actually strongly suggest using a target from [[https://github.com/HaoZeke/Dotfiles][my Dotfiles]] in conjunction with this, but it isn't really required, so:
#+BEGIN_SRC
~/.local/bin/dotgit restore hzhpc
#+END_SRC
Note that because of the suggested separation, I have not opted to setup a shell or even ensure that there are scripts here to help keep ~module~ in your path. Those are in [[https://github.com/HaoZeke/Dotfiles][my Dotfiles]].
